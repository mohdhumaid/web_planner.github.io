							<p>At this time, the Einsteins started to have their first revelation about event technology, AV & event production companies. As the company expanded, they worked with dozens of companies across the country to produce their events. What they realized is there was a fundamental flaw in most event production companies… they aren’t enjoyable to work with. They never explained what they were supplying, so you had no idea what you were getting unless you were super technical. When issues popped up, they seemed apathetic, but spent more time playing the blame game than fixing the issue. So we had a serious eureka moment… Why don’t we create a better event production company?</p>
